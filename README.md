# Plant Species Recognition System 🌿🔍

Welcome to the **Plant Species Recognition System**!  
Our mission is to help identify plant species efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect the species it belongs to. Together, let's classify plants, protect them, and contribute to a healthy ecosystem!

## 🌟 **How It Works**
1. **Upload Image**: Go to the **Species Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant whose species you want to know about.
2. **Analysis**: Our system processes the image using advanced CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithms to identify the species of the plant.
3. **Results**: View the results and recommendations for further action.

## 📊 **About the Dataset**
- This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.  
- The original dataset can be found on this repo.  
- It consists of **987 RGB images** of different plants belonging to **4 species**, divided as follows:
  - **Train**: 987 images
  - **Validation**: 211 images
  - **Test**: 212 images  

⚠️ Due to resource limitations, we focus on **4 species only**.
